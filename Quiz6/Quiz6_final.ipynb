    "Using the instructions laid out in the README file, I opened two windows of a VM instance and executed the commands, having the output from the listener being stored in a .txt file. I then wrote the following python program to analyze the output file and for within each different sender, find the average number of times each of of its unique queries was output, for which I got the number 3.04. THis is pretty much the exact number I was expecting to see, since I let the program run for just over 3 minutes and each sender has 60 unique queries it can output, and it outputs at an avg of one query a second, so doing the math 3.04 is the exact average I would expect.
